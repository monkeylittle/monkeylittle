I finally got around to watching Jurgen Holler's presentation [Spring and Java EE 6: Synergy or Competition](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Spring-Java-EE6).

It is quite a comprehensive presentation that starts out looking at and overview of JEE 6. New platform services such as JEE Profiles, Servlet 3.0 and Authentication Service Providers are discussed, as well as new and updated user component models such as JSF 2.0, JPA 2.0, JSR-303 (Bean Validation), JAX-RS, EJB 3.1 and JSR-299 (Context and Dependency Injection).

Next Jurgen looks at how Spring continues to incorporate support for these enhancements. I'll be particularily interested to see how support for JSF is improved in the upcoming releases of Spring.

Jurgan provides a nice comparison of JAX-RS and the Spring support for REST. This probably deserves a presentation in itself. There is also a high level overview of JEE 6 Singleton Beans and a comparison with Spring managed singleton beans.

Finally, JSR-299 (Contexts and Dependency Injection) is discussed at length before a concise summary of his 1 hour 30 minute presentation.

Quite long, but very interesting and well worth watching.
