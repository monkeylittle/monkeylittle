At Devoxx 2010, Max Katz of Exadel presented [Mobile Development Choices: Native vs Web](http://www.slideshare.net/maxkatz/devoxx2010-mobile-development-choices-native-apps-vs-web-apps). He kindly posted the slides on Slideshare and I have been eager to review the presentation as this is a development choice I have been considering lately.

The presentation is very good (although no doubt better in the flesh) and provides some background before laying out the main areas to be considered when making the choice between native and web. I'm not going to rehash or summarise the content but if your interested or involved in mobile development, I would highly recommend spending a few minutes to look through the presentation.

It's a pity that the presentation was not available through vimeo.com or similar because it's such an interesting topic and audio would have added a lot to the presentation.
