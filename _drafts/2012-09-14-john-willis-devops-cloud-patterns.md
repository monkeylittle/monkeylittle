I've been a bit under the weather and was off work today so I decided that I would catch up on some reading (and watching video etc.).  One of the things I stumbled upon was John Willis' [DevOps Cloud Patterns](http://devops.com/2012/09/09/devops-cloud-patterns/) talk at Build a Cloud Day.  As the title suggests, John speaks about DevOps and Cloud.  He also spends some time discussing the history that has led us to DevOps and the companies that are the most successful practitioners.  I found it really interesting and engaging and it's well worth a watch if you have an hour to spare.
